# Flock

Flock is a Python flocking simulator inspired by [Boids)(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids).
It simulates the behavior of a flock of indepedent agents (birds), each following
the same set of rules. Complex behavior emerges from the group, despite the lack
of organization.

## Usage

Run flock.py to launch the sim. Press space to disperse the flock. 
Note that the birds are afraid of the mouse.
